Unless your mole has recently changed in size, shape or color, no treatment is necessary for an intradermal nevus. However, it is possible to remove the mole if that’s what you’d like. Electrocautery, shave excision and laser treatment are therapeutic options. Referral to a dermatologist is preferred to exclude amelanotic melanoma.",37

Pityriasis versicolor is more common in hot, humid climates than in cool, dry climates. It often affects people who perspire heavily. It may clear in the winter months and recur each summer. Although it is not considered infectious in the conventional sense, pityriasis versicolor sometimes affects more than one member of a family. Mild pityriasis versicolor is treated with topical antifungal agents. Selenium sulfide shampoo, Topical azole cream/shampoo (econazole, ketoconazole), Terbinafine gel. The medicine should be applied widely to the skin from the jawline down and left on the skin for 5-15 minutes before rinsing off in the shower. This should be done daily for one week then weekly for one month. Oral antifungal agents, itraconazole and fluconazole, are used to treat pityriasis versicolor when extensive or if topical agents have failed. Vigorous exercise an hour after taking the medication may help sweat it onto the skin surface, where it can effectively eradicate the yeast. Bathing should be avoided for a few hours. A few days' treatment will clear many cases of pityriasis long term, or at least for several months. Reapplication of a topical treatment such as selenium sulfide shampoo every month once the rash has cleared will usually prevent recurrence.",38
11g9d4t.jpg,"It is a case of common wart. This non-cancerous growth appears when your skin is infected with one of the many viruses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options. ",39

It can arise de novo in normal-appearing skin or within an existing melanoma of another type. These cells may occasionally arise from an existing melanocytic naevus (about 3%) but commonly occur within another type of melanoma or in previously normal-appearing skin. What triggers the melanocytes to become malignant is unknown, but it is likely to be a series of changes to the DNA. It is essential to diagnose nodular melanoma accurately. Clinical diagnosis is aided by dermoscopy and skin biopsy (usually excision biopsy) at your dermatologist. Those with melanoma that is more than 1 mm thick may be advised to have a lymph node biopsy, imaging studies, and blood tests. The initial treatment of primary melanoma is to cut it out; the lesion should be completely excised with a 2-3 cm margin of normal tissue. ",41

11pw9du.jpg,"Eyelid bumps come in many forms, including styes, chalazia, xanthelasma, and milia. They might be white, red, or yellow. They don’t usually cause problems, but some can be a sign of a more serious problem. A stye looks like a pimple or a blister, usually along the outer rim of your eyelid. It’s red and painful to the touch. A chalazion will often grow on the underside of your eyelid, behind your eyelashes, or midway up your eyelid. These are more likely to form on your upper eyelid. A chalazion can look like a stye but may grow larger, up to the size of a pea. It’s also more likely to come back. Xanthelasma are soft yellow collections of plaque under your skin, usually near your nose. A milium is a tiny white cyst. Most probably this is a case of chalazion. A chalazion happens when a tiny part of your eyelid called a meibomian gland becomes blocked. You can also get it from a stye that is no longer infected but has left hardened material stuck in a gland. Styes and chalazia usually clear up on their own in a few weeks, but there are ways you can move the process along:
Never poke, squeeze, or try to pop a stye or a chalazion. This could cause a more serious problem. Put a warm, damp cloth on your eye several times a day. Massage the swollen area gently to help drain the clogged gland. Remember: gently. Once the bump drains, keep the area clean and keep your hands away from your eyes. Go without eye makeup or contact lenses until the eyelid has healed. (Your contacts may hold bacteria that caused the infection). Clean and disinfect your lenses before using them again, along with any accessories you've used. If you have a large, painful stye or chalazion that doesn’t go away, see an ophthalmologist. They may prescribe an antibiotic to help clear it up. In severe cases, your doctor can drain the bump and give you antibiotics or a steroid injection to help it heal.",81

r6nver.jpg,"Discoloration around the mouth is a common manifestation of hyperpigmentation. These darkened areas of skin tend to develop in small patches, and may occur anywhere on the body. The discoloration is a direct result of increased melanin production in your skin. While not usually serious, hyperpigmentation may be attributed to underlying medical conditions, sun exposure, lifestyle habits, and medications. Skin pigment changes may also be associated with vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin B12 and vitamin D. People with dark skin are more prone to hyperpigmentation overall. This is because of a higher rate of melanin production compared to light skin. Dark spots may fade if you take sun protection measures, including wearing sunscreen every day. The mouth area is often missed when applying sunscreen, so be sure to do so daily and reapply as needed. Exfoliation and skin brightening serums containing antioxidants like vitamin C may also help reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. A dermatologist may recommend one of the following options:
prescription-strength retinoids or hydroquinone, azelaic acid to reduce discoloration and inflammation, kojic acid for melasma and age spots, laser therapy for dark spots, chemical peels to help exfoliate the skin and reduce the appearance of pigmentation, switching medications, if recommended.",83

While many things can damage your hair follicles, the following are also common causes of folliculitis hot tub (improperly maintained), shaving, plucking, or waxing, tight clothing or equipment, medication applied to the skin, such as coal tar, medication you take, or weight gain. Apply a warm compress at least 3 to 4 times a day. Leave the compress on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes each time. When shaving, plucking, or waxing causes the infection, you’ll want to stop doing these things for 30 days. Wear loose clothing when it’s hot and humid. Use well-maintained hot tubs. Wash your bathing suit or wetsuit after each use and let it dry. The treatment of acneiform eruptions depends on the cause. In most cases, if the cause is an organism or a drug, then the exposure should be discontinued. Most patients recover within a few weeks. For any residual lesions, treatments that have been used to treat acneiform eruptions include laser ablation, excision, topical or oral antibiotics, drug withdrawal, or the use of topical or oral retinoids.

Oral antifungal agents, itraconazole and fluconazole, are used to treat pityriasis versicolor when extensive or if topical agents have failed. Vigorous exercise an hour after taking the medication may help sweat it onto the skin surface, where it can effectively eradicate the yeast. Bathing should be avoided for a few hours. A few days' treatment will clear many cases of pityriasis long term, or at least for several months. Reapplication of a topical treatment such as selenium sulfide shampoo every month once the rash has cleared will usually prevent recurrence.",113
1281whp.jpg,"Most probably it is a case of hormonal acne. Acne is largely a hormonal condition that’s driven by androgen hormones (testosterone). This typically becomes active during teenage and young adult years. Mild acne can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as gels, soaps, pads, creams, and lotions, that are applied to the skin. Creams and lotions are best for sensitive skin. Alcohol-based gels dry the skin and are better for oily skin. It is advisable to start with the lowest strengths, as some preparations can cause skin irritation, redness, or burning on first use. Topical acne medications include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and antibiotics like clindamycin or erythromycin.",114

Thus, it is recommended to either always be completely clean shaven, let the hairs grow out without shaving, or undergo laser hair removal. You can also use a topical antibiotic, topical retinoids, or an oral antibiotic to help, but you need to first stop the underlying problem of allowing the short hairs to curl back into the skin.

Additionally, it could be eczema, folliculitis, or contact dermatitis. You should be seen by a doctor to see if it looks more like shingles in person, as you would benegit from an antiviral medication in that case. Otherwise, a topical antibiotic or topical steroid will likely help, but it's important to treat shingles first if it looks more consistent with shingles in person. Your doctor could also consider swabbing one of the bumps with a Q-tip to test for the virus that causes shingles",129
